## Flight:carbon model
# This module is used by [Brighter Planet](http://brighterplanet.com)'s carbon emission [web service](http://carbon.brighterplanet.com) to estimate the **greenhouse gas emissions of passenger air travel**.
#
# The final estimate is the result of the **calculations** detailed below.
# These calculations are performed in reverse order, starting with the last calculation listed and finishing with the `emission` calculation.
#
# To accomodate varying input data, each calculation may have one or more **methods**. These are listed under each calculation in order from most to least preferred.
