  # virtual has_many association
  # has_many :segments won't work because there's no general way to specify the correct conditions
  # even if you get clever with it, like
  # has_many  :segments,
  #           :class_name => 'FlightSegment',
  #           :foreign_key => 'origin_airport_id',
  #           :conditions => 'flight_segments.destination_airport_id = #{id}'
  # you get queries like "`flight_segments`.origin_airport_id = 3654 AND (flight_segments.destination_airport_id = 3654))"
  # in which you notice the AND which must be an OR
  # and you can't just do finder_sql, because that breaks any other :select
